# Deploying-an-Application-on-AWS-EC2



# Problem Statement: Manual Deployment of a Web Application on AWS EC2 Instance
The objective of this project is to manually deploy a web application on an AWS EC2 instance. This project focuses on setting up an EC2 instance, configuring the environment, installing necessary dependencies, deploying a pre-built application, and exposing it to the internet securely.

The deployment process involves provisioning an EC2 instance, securely connecting to it using SSH, installing required software packages like NGINX, Node.js, and Git, cloning the application code from a repository, running the application, configuring security groups, setting up a reverse proxy using NGINX, and ensuring the application is accessible over the internet.

This project demonstrates foundational skills in cloud computing, Linux administration, network security, and application deployment on AWS infrastructure without automation tools â€” enabling learners to understand the essential steps behind modern deployment pipelines
